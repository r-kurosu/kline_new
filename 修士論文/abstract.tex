\end{center}
Our research considers the situation in which cars are transported to several ports of various countries by a carrier ship. Two stages of work called stowage planning and simulation planning are performed before loading a collection of cars onto a pure car carrier (PCC). The stowage planning stage considers assigning cars to one of the areas called holds, a few of which compose each level of the ship. The simulation planning stage places the cars assigned to each area in the stowage planning one by one considering the orientation of cars.
 In our research, as the first step of fully automating the stowage planning and simulation planning, we aim to output efficient stowage plans.
 We propose heuristic algorithm to solve large instances, and also propose a method to reduce computation time while keeping the quality of solution.
